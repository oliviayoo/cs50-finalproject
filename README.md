CS50 Fall 2020 Final Project : Mr. Miyagi's Movie Machine
Olivia Yoo and Nalani Dziama
Last Updated December 8 2020

Project was originally written on CS50's IDE - has since been transferred here for backup.
The project is a Flask web application supported by CS50's IDE.

This is a web application that supports a user creating an account, searching for information
about movies (release year, actors, etc), adding movies to a user's watchlist, allowing the 
user to review movies, and randomly generating movie suggestions from the top 100 movies on
IMDB. The web application is designed with a Mr. Miyagi theme.

The data was obtained from Harry Merritt's Unofficial IMDB database
    https://rapidapi.com/hmerritt/api/imdb-internet-movie-database-unofficial/details.
